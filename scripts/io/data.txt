Python for fun.
There are many ways to read file.
read(): read all content
read(size): read at most size each time
readline(): read one line each time
readlines(): read once, each time return a line.

If the file is small, use read();
If not sure how big that file is, use read(size);
If read config file, readlines() is most convenient.
